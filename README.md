## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I'm a software engineer who (hopefully) has already crossed the **Valley of Despair** in the Dunning-Kruger effect journey. With a solid foundation built through studies and professional experience, I've come to realize just how vast the field of tech is. No matter the challenge, I'm committed to continuous learning and pushing forward with enthusiasm and resilience.

In addition to my software interests, Iâ€™m also deeply into hardware, including computers, smartphones, accessories, and various gadgets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- In 2024, I finally made significant improvements in my spoken English, which had been a challenge. This opened up new opportunities for me. However, I still need to put in a lot of work to attain the level of fluency I'm aspiring to.
- In my free time, Iâ€™m developing a mod for the game *Guilty Gear XX Reload*, which aims to refresh and enhance an existing flawed online mode. The task is challenging due to the original code's comments and README being written in Japanese. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/guilty-gear-xx-reload).
- I plan to learn Kotlin to become more flexible within the JVM stack.
- In 2025, I began my journey of learning the Japanese language.
